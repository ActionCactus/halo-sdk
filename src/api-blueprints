## Messages [/messages{?page,perPage,fields,sort,id,read,sender,subject,message,tags,categories,createdAt,updatedAt}]

### Get Messages [GET]
Get a collection of messages. See the Message model for more information.
+ Parameters
    + page (number, optional)

        Endpoints that return collections are automatically paginated and the first page of results is returned. The desired page number can be targeted using this parameter. e.g. page=2 would return the second page of results.

    + perPage (number, optional)

        Endpoints that return collections are automatically paginated with 10 results per page . The desired number of results per page can be set using this parameter. e.g. perPage=20 would return the 20 results on each page.

    + fields (string, optional)

        It is possible to restrict data models response fields in order to reduce response size. It is possible to specify the fields of the returning model that should be populated with data using a comma separated list of field name. e.g. fields=name,createdAt,updatedAt

    + sort (string, optional)

        The response collection can be sorted into an order based on a specific field value.  The parameter expects a field name from the response model. It is possible to prefix the field name with a minus sign (-) to invert the sort order. e.g. sort=createdAt or sort=-createdAt 

    + id (string, optional)

        Apply a search filter specifically for this model field. The parameter takes a collection of comma separated values that are interpreted  as 'OR' statements. e.g. 'name=foo,baa,lee' will filter the search so that field name must be equal to 'foo' or 'baa' or 'lee'. The query comparator that prefixes the first value can be extended to customise the meaning of the filter condition. Adding an additional '=' creates a 'LIKE' filter instead of 'EQUALS'. e.g. 'name==am' would return all results that  where the model field 'name' is 'LIKE' 'am'. So 'Sam', 'Pam', 'Amber' etc. are valid results. Numerical based fields can use the '>' and '<' to respectively query values that are greater than and smaller than. e.g. 'value=>10' will return only models where the field value is greater than 10. Simple collection fields can use the '^' prefix to indicate a 'CONTAINS' filter. e.g. 'values=^foo' will only return models whether the values field collection contains the value 'foo'.

    + read (string, optional)

So 'Sam', 'Pam', 'Amber' etc. are valid results. Numerical based fields can use the '>' and '<' to respectively query values that are greater than and smaller than. e.g. 'value=>10' will return only models where the field value is greater than 10. Simple collection fields can use the '^' prefix to indicate a 'CONTAINS' filter. e.g. 'values=^foo' will only return models whether the values field collection contains the value 'foo'.

    + team_id (string, required)

        The URI path must specify the parent team ID.


### Get Team Users [GET]
Get a collection of users associated with a team. See the Person model for more information.
+ Parameters
    + page (number, optional)

        Endpoints that return collections are automatically paginated and the first page of results is returned. The desired page number can be targeted using this parameter. e.g. page=2 would return the second page of results.

    + perPage (number, optional)

        Endpoints that return collections are automatically paginated with 10 results per page . The desired number of results per page can be set using this parameter. e.g. perPage=20 would return the 20 results on each page.

    + fields (string, optional)

        It is possible to restrict data models response fields in order to reduce response size. It is possible to specify the fields of the returning model that should be populated with data using a comma separated list of field name. e.g. fields=name,createdAt,updatedAt

    + sort (string, optional)

        The response collection can be sorted into an order based on a specific field value.  The parameter expects a field name from the response model. It is possible to prefix the field name with a minus sign (-) to invert the sort order. e.g. sort=createdAt or sort=-createdAt 

    + id (string, optional)

        Apply a search filter specifically for this model field. The parameter takes a collection of comma separated values that are interpreted  as 'OR' statements. e.g. 'name=foo,baa,lee' will filter the search so that field name must be equal to 'foo' or 'baa' or 'lee'. The query comparator that prefixes the first value can be extended to customise the meaning of the filter condition. Adding an additional '=' creates a 'LIKE' filter instead of 'EQUALS'. e.g. 'name==am' would return all results that  where the model field 'name' is 'LIKE' 'am'. So 'Sam', 'Pam', 'Amber' etc. are valid results. Numerical based fields can use the '>' and '<' to respectively query values that are greater than and smaller than. e.g. 'value=>10' will return only models where the field value is greater than 10. Simple collection fields can use the '^' prefix to indicate a 'CONTAINS' filter. e.g. 'values=^foo' will only return models whether the values field collection contains the value 'foo'.

    + name (string, optional)

The query comparator that prefixes the first value can be extended to customise the meaning of the filter condition. Adding an additional '=' creates a 'LIKE' filter instead of 'EQUALS'. e.g. 'name==am' would return all results that  where the model field 'name' is 'LIKE' 'am'. So 'Sam', 'Pam', 'Amber' etc. are valid results. Numerical based fields can use the '>' and '<' to respectively query values that are greater than and smaller than. e.g. 'value=>10' will return only models where the field value is greater than 10. Simple collection fields can use the '^' prefix to indicate a 'CONTAINS' filter. e.g. 'values=^foo' will only return models whether the values field collection contains the value 'foo'.

The parameter takes a collection of comma separated values that are interpreted  as 'OR' statements. e.g. 'name=foo,baa,lee' will filter the search so that field name must be equal to 'foo' or 'baa' or 'lee'. The query comparator that prefixes the first value can be extended to customise the meaning of the filter condition. Adding an additional '=' creates a 'LIKE' filter instead of 'EQUALS'. e.g. 'name==am' would return all results that  where the model field 'name' is 'LIKE' 'am'. So 'Sam', 'Pam', 'Amber' etc. are valid results. Numerical based fields can use the '>' and '<' to respectively query values that are greater than and smaller than. e.g. 'value=>10' will return only models where the field value is greater than 10. Simple collection fields can use the '^' prefix to indicate a 'CONTAINS' filter. e.g. 'values=^foo' will only return models whether the values field collection contains the value 'foo'.
